# Embryo
The Embryo manifest outlines the initial vision and objectives of an experimental project by answering a few questions.

## What is the project’s objective?

_Clearly define the purpose and utility of the project._
→ Summarize in one sentence what the project is supposed to do.

Interact with leetcode in your terminal (get info / code, submit problem for any language) and get info on your profile.

## What value does it bring?

_Why is this project worth developing or using?_
→ Explain what users (or yourself) will gain or learn from this project.

leetcode code interface doesn't support a fully integrated IDE experience yet, so it's a little painful to write code there. allow to bring a problem down to a local environment.

## What are the completion criteria?**
_When is the project considered at a major milestone?_
→ Define milestones or issues that help measure progress.
